# TriviaGame (Hangman)

This is a simple javascript game that picks a random word from an array, then displays dashes indicating how many letters are in that particular word. As the user guesses letters their guesses are displayed on the page and correct guesses replace the dashes.  If the word is guessed within the correct amount of guesses available.

## Getting Started

Begin by simply typing the letters to begin guessing the word. As you do, the remaining guesses counter will decrement. if you guess the word within the allowed number of guesses, you win the game and will be given a new word. Additionally, the number of wins will increase with each success. Likewise the Losses will increase by one each time you use all the guesses without guessing the word.
